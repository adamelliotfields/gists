# REST APIs
> :calendar: *March 9, 2017*

### REST
 - REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
 - REST sits on top of HTTP and defines how your API works.
 - It's a set of rules for how to use the HTTP framework to access bits and pieces of your application or data in reliable and predictable ways.


### API
 - An Application Programming Interface is a gateway for external applications to interface with our code.


### Resources (Nouns)
 - A resource is a piece of data, which usually comes out of a database.
 - Resources are gathered together into collections.
 - Resources are usually available at endpoints that point to either individual resources or collections of resources. 


### HTTP Request Methods (Verbs)
 - `GET` is used for fetching either a collection of resources or a single resource.
 - `POST` is used to add a new resource to a collection.
 - `PUT` is used to update a record.
 - `DELETE` sends a request to a detail record (a URL for a single record).


### Query Strings
 - Query strings come after a question mark in a URL as a set of key-value pairs. 


### HTTP Request Headers
 - `Accept` specifies the file format the requester wants.
 - `Accept-Language` specifies the human-readable language.
 - `Cache-Control` specifies whether the response can be generated from a cache.

### HTTP Response
 - `Content-Type`
 - `Last-Modified`
 - `Status`
