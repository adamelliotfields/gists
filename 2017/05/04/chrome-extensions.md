# Chrome Extensions
A list of Chrome extensions I find useful for web development.  

[Wappalyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg)  
Gives you a list of the technologies used on a particular website. Useful for seeing how popular React is and also for discovering new tools you may not have heard about.  

[CSS Peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk)  
Get the fonts and color palette from any website so you don't have to Google "Spotify green" or "Twitch purple".  

[Emmet Review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emmet-review/epejoicbhllgiimigokgjdoijnpaphdp)  
Brings up a wall of different mobile screen sizes so you can test the responsiveness of your site. Also check out [sizzy](https://sizzy.co/).  

[jQuery Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jquery-injector/ekkjohcjbjcjjifokpingdbdlfekjcgi)  
If you've ever wanted a site to have jQuery so you could manipulate it in Chrome Dev Tools, now you can.  

[JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa)  
View JSON responses from APIs in the browser and traverse them in the console.  

[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)  
Inspect React components in Chrome Dev Tools.  

[Node Inspector Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nodejs-v8-inspector-manag/gnhhdgbaldcilmgcpfddgdbkhjohddkj)  
Listens for `node --inspect` and automatically opens a tab in Chrome with the Node debugger console.  

[NPM Hub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/npmhub/kbbbjimdjbjclaebffknlabpogocablj)  
When viewing a repository on GitHub with a package.json, you'll now see a list of dependencies below the README.  

[Markdown Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk)  
Renders Markdown as HTML in the browser. Can choose from different styles, including GitHub Flavored Markdown.
