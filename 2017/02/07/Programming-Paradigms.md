# Programming Paradigms

### Imperative
 - Control flow is an explicit sequence of commands.
 - Use of direct assignments and global variables.
 - Variables are mutable and state can change.

### Structured
 - A style of imperative programming. 
 - Strict use of indentation to define the programs structure.

### Procedural
 - Derived from structured programming.
 - Uses local variables and modularization (e.g., MVC Architecture).

### Functional
 - The opposite of imperative programming.
 - Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions (i.e., expressions).
 - Avoids mutating data and changing state.
 - Incorporates recursive functions.
 - Originated from lambda calculus. 
 - Commonly used in academia. 

### Object Oriented
 - Based on objects which can contain data (properties) and procedures (methods).
 - Procedures can modify the data of an object, or even the calling object itself (i.e., open recursion using the “this” keyword).
 - Programs are designed by creating objects that interact with one another. 
 - Objects are instances of classes.
 - Data and procedures can be encapsulated (protected) (e.g., the private keyword in PHP). 
 - Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes (parent/child classes or superclasses/subclasses).
 - Incorporates dynamic dispatch and polymorphism.
 - Most programming languages are multi-paradigm that can support object oriented programming.

### Event-driven
 - Control flow is determined by user events or changes in state.
 - Incorporates event handlers and asynchronous processes.
 - Incorporates an event loop to listen for for events and invoke callback functions.
 - jQuery (client-side) and Node (server-side) are examples of event-driven programming.

### Declarative
 - Defines the result without detailing its control flow.
 - SQL or CSS are two examples of declarative programming.
