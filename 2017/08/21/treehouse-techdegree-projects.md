## Front End Web Development

### Personal Portfolio Page
Customize a personal online profile by adding graphics, customizing text, and improving the look of
a web page using Cascading Style Sheets, the formatting language of the web. Share your finished
project on GitHub, a website used by teams of programmers to share and work on programming code.

### Responsive Layout
Designing web pages that look and function well on multiple screen sizes is an essential skill for a
web developer. Using HTML, CSS, and responsive design, you'll create a mobile-first web page with a
layout that adjusts to fit mobile phones, tablets and desktop displays.

### Online Registration Form
Web forms appear everywhere online: forms allow users to order books, sign up for web sites, and
post to Facebook. This project challenges you to build a responsive, mobile-first registration form
using a variety of HTML form elements.

### Interactive Photo Gallery
Interactive image galleries are a common feature of many websites, from photo sites to e-commerce
applications. Use HTML, CSS and the popular programming language JavaScript to create an
interactive, searchable gallery of photos.

### Build a Web Style Guide
Sass is an important tool in a modern Front End Web Developer’s toolbox. It's used by many
developers to make styling web pages with CSS easier and faster. Create a style guide using BEM
style classes to quickly prototype and apply a consistent look across multiple pages of a site.

### SVG Site Update
Master Scaleable Vector Graphics. SVG graphics are quickly becoming one of the most widely used
graphic formats on the Web. Modernize the user interface of a web page by adding, styling and
optimizing SVG graphics.

### Interactive Video Player
Build an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Video, and the interface used
to control the video, is increasingly important for many different kinds of web applications,
including web site landing pages, blogs, podcasts, product marketing and training.

### Accessibility Refactor
Accessible web sites allow anyone and everyone to use the web, regardless of physical or hardware
differences. They also, generally, make sites faster to download and improve a site's search engine
friendliness. Modify a website to make it more accessible for users and search engines.

### Web App Dashboard
Build an interactive dashboard for a web application using advanced web techniques including SVG
graphics and JavaScript programming. The project involves creating tables, charts, graphics and
other user interface components in a manner that promotes interactivity and usability.

### Use a Public API to Create a Front End for an Employee Directory
Many sites — Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Wikipedia to name a few — offer a vast sea of data that
you can access and display on your own web pages. Using JavaScript, you’ll create an employee
directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).

### Optimizing a Site for Performance
Web site performance is often a live-or-die metric for web sites and apps. Sites and apps that load,
or appear to load, quickly are usually seen as being better built and more useful. You'll optimize a
web site to improve its speed and performance.

### Online Portfolio
The final capstone project for the Front End Web Development Techdegree Program. Show off your skill
and expertise in the tools and techniques you've learned in the Techdegree by building a
professional portfolio to showcase your work.

data-modeling problems, write elegant JavaScript code, and apply higher level concepts like
object-oriented programming.

### Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory (formerly Spotify API)
Many sites — Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Wikipedia to name a few — offer a vast sea of data that
you can access and display on your own web pages. Using JavaScript, you’ll create an employee
directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).

### Build a Content Scraper

on web servers and even your own computer. Create a command-line application to read a web page,
extract information, and store the data in a text file.

### Build a Twitter Interface
Use Node.js and Express to retrieve information from your Twitter account. Use Twitter's REST API to
communicate with Twitter, retrieve JSON data, and display the results using a HTML template.

### Using Gulp to Build a Front End Website
Professional front end web developers need to be fast and productive. This means working quickly and
efficiently to create sites that perform well. Implement a quick and efficient professional workflow
using JavaScript, NPM and Node.

### AngularJS Single Page App
Create a seamless user experience by building a single page application (SPA) using AngularJS. The
project communicates with an Express REST API, to add, edit, retrieve and display recipes.

### Build a Library Manager
Working with databases — storing, retrieving, updating and deleting information — is an important
software developer talent. Create a web application for searching, adding and updating items in a
lending library, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and SQLite.

### Build a Course Rating API with Express
In this project, you’ll use the popular web application framework Express, along with a MongoDB
database, to create the back end for a "Course Rating Application" which lets users create, edit and
rate courses.

### Build Your Own Web App
Build a complete web application in this Capstone project. Build all aspects of the site including
an interactive front end. On the backend, manage data with a database, talk to APIs, and, host the
site on the web so the world can see your finished, running web application.

Experience with many types of websites is key for the best learning and understanding of Python web
development. In this project, you will build a site that displays information about various minerals
(rocks) using the Django framework. The site will display a list of all of the minerals in a
database, with additional details available by clicking on specific minerals. Building apps in two
different web frameworks will teach you what is similar and different in each and equip you with the
knowledge to know which tool to use for different types of projects.

identify where it's broken and inefficient. Write and run tests, check for proper validation,
analyze views and analyze database calls to improve the site.

### Todo API with Flask
Build a complete Python API (application programming interface) for a to-do list. An API is a
back-end client that runs on the server and supplies information and runs tasks for the visual,
front-end of a web site. Use Flask to create a database and REST API.

### Pug or Ugh API
Create a backend API for a fully coded front end web site. Build out the database and REST API
backend using the Django REST Framework. You'll create database models, program routes, and use
token-based authentication to control access to the API.

Hibernate to create a Java web application. The application lets users create projects, add roles to
a project (e.g. developer or designer), assign collaborators, and manage the project.

### Fix and Enhance an E-Commerce Shopping Cart
Working with pre-existing, or "legacy," code is a common task for every developer. Take an existing
e-commerce shopping cart application and identify bugs, fix them, and add new feature enhancements
to improve the application's quality and functionality.

### Todo API with Spark
Build a RESTful Java API for a to-do list application. Using Spark, build out the server side
components needed to let an already-built front end add, remove and edit items in a to-do list. Use
JDBC, JSON, REST best practices and add resilient error-handling routines to handle any situation.

Android app to track current position over time. Store the position data and look and view each
position plotted on a map.

### Enhance a Messaging App in Android
Developers frequently work with previously written code and sometimes that code has problems. Take
an Android messaging app that contains bugs and write unit tests and fix the bugs. Add new features
like the ability to include photos and videos, and messages that "self-destruct".

variety of amusement park visitors  and test if a set of  business rules are enforced when the
passes are swiped at various park locations.

### The API Awakens
Harness the power of a third-party API (application programming interface) to provide data for an
iOS app. Using tools like networking, concurrency, and JSON, you will build an app that retrieves
information about people, vehicles, and starships from Star Wars by connecting with the Star Wars
API.

### Movie Night
Build an iOS app to help two friends select a movie to watch. The app will collect movie criteria
from the two users and access the Movie Database API to provide a movie recommendation. You'll
