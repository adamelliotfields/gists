### Other Frameworks Worth Trying in 2017

*   Polymer
*   Riot
*   Mithril
*   Aurelia

### Notes

1.  I'm intentionally not listing online bootcamps, Lynda, or Pluralsight/CodeSchool.
2.  Udemy pricing is based on using a promo code (which they offer monthly).
3.  There are tons of free YouTube screencasts available, but the quality varies significantly.
